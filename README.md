In this notebook you will practice Python related to data science,
including using the matplotlib module we introduced in class.
Recall that you have links to references on Moodle that you may find helpful.

Almost all of our code this semester will involve reading in a 
file of data and then processing it. You should already know how to do so using either a while loop or a for loop from your prior programming experience.

In the below cell, complete the function that uses one of these looping approaches to read in a file, 
and store each line of the file as an element of type int in a list. The name of the file is passed as a parameter.

Note: You must use a loop to process this file. Other perfectly valid approaches exist for reading files in Python,
but we would like to see that you understand the looping approach.
